# Bio

My name is Lucas Fisher, and I am 21 years old.  I am a senior at MSU in electrical engineering.  I enjoy playing video games with my friends.  In the past, I played the saxophone in band and competed in archery competitions.  I haven't done much programming in a while, so I may not know what I am doing.
